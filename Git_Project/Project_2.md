## Capstone Project: Enhancing a Community Library Website. ##

You're part of a development team tasked with enhancing the website for the "Greenwood Community Library." The website aims to be more engaging and informative for its visitors. It currently includes basic sections: Home, About Us, Events, and Contact Us.

Your team decides to add a "Book Reviews" section and update the
"Events" page to feature upcoming community events.
