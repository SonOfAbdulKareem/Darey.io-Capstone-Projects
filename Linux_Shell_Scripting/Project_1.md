## Bash Script For Generating a Multiplication Table

## Project Requirements

**User Input for Number:** The script must first ask the user to input a number for which the multiplication table will be generated.

**Choice of Table Range:** Next, ask the user if they want a full multiplication table (1 to 10) or a partial table. If they choose partial, prompt them for the start and end of the range.

**Use of Loops:** Implement the logic to generate the multiplication table using loops. You may use either the list form or C-style for loop based on what's appropriate.

**Conditional Logic:** Use if-else statements to handle the logic based on the user's choices (full vs. partial table and valid range input).

**Input Validation:** Ensure that the user enters valid numbers for the multiplication table and the specified range. Provide feedback for invalid inputs and default to a full table if the range is incorrect.
**
Readable Output:** Display the multiplication table in a clear and readable format, adhering to the user's choice of range.

**Comments and Code Quality:** Your script should be well-commented, explaining the purpose of different sections and any important variables or logic used. Ensure the code is neatly formatted for easy readability.
